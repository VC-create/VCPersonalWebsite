      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <img src = "assets/sun.jpg" alt = "sun smiling with a           flower crown">
      <p>I'm passionate about computer science and using it to make a positive change in the world. I am also passionate about climate action and have led a workshop and done presentations in the past to raise awareness about how fast fashion contributes to climate change and what we can do to take action. I also am involved in my city's youth council, where I work on adressing issues in the city, like teen mental health, and have worked on some cool projects like helping design our library's new teen space!  Finally, I like to volunteer at my library to help with events and have helped at the local park district in the past to clean and pave trails to make them safer, as well as help seniors with technology. I have also worked with my city's science center to help set up and clean up at science events. </p>
